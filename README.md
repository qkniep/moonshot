# Moonshot

This will be my contribution to GitHub's 2020 Game Off.

I am writing a strategy game in Rust using the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.
The game plays in space and will probably have something to do with mining moons for minerals,
destroying your opponent's moons, and flying around with rockets.
